/*-------------------------------------*/ SERVER-SIDE PROGRAMMING
// this means writing code that runs on another computer functioning as SERVER
// using DATABASE to store and retrieve information
// login pages are almost always created with the help of SERVER-SIDE code
// server-side code helps provide a tailored experience for each user
// TAILORED EXPERIENCE = dynamic experience
// server-side code creates LOGIN pages with USERNAME and PASSWORD
// opening a social network and showing a list of a user's friends
// => this situation requires a TAILORED EXPERIENCE
// creating TAILORED EXPERIENCES, like showing a user's msgs after logging in
// => this is a KEY SKILL in modern full-stack web development


/*-------------------------------------*/
// tailored webpages start with HTML
// usually when clicking a link, the browser makes a "HTTP request" to retrieve some new data
// HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
// "WEB BROWSERS" use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to communicate with "WEB SERVERS"
// it is how the browser communicates with the server when you click on a URL link

/*-------------------------------------*/
// the browser makes a REQUEST to the server (REQUESTING DATA)
// the server sends back a RESPONSE (RECEIVING a RESPONSE)
